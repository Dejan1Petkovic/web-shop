# web-shop
Final test "Front end" - Krojaceva skola.
I got from our designer all the photos, dimensions and how the page should look like. Also I got JSON file, with products information.
My job was to code, style, create single page application to be full responsive, and to make functionality using HTML, SASS, Bootstrap, Java Script, Ajax and jQUERY.
